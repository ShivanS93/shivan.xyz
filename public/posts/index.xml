      <description>When we think about programming efficiently, we think about how fast we can type on a keyboard.
This is true to a certain point. But it comes to a point where the faster you type doesn&amp;rsquo;t improve your ability to program. What now becomes more important is your ability to reduce the number of keystrokes, navigate through your code, as well as remain in that all important flow.

      <description>The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.
Donâ€™t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine.
