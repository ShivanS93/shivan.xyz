This is source code for [my blog](https://shivan.xyz).

## How is works

This uses [Hugo, the static site generator](https://gohugo.io).

## Theme

The theme is [Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

## Some Customisations

I have added a makefile. Some custom commands:

- `make drafts` - this will print the articles that are drafts.
