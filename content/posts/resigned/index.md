My biggest news of recent weeks is my resignation from my position as Vice President of my weightlifting club of which I am a member (not my job if that’s what you clicked on — sorry!). In some previous newsletters, I briefly mentioned my trepidation towards my appointment in this role.

> Vice Presidency - We had the AGM for our weightlifting club and I have been elected as vice president. I am nervous since I have a lot on my plate currently, and I don't want to let the team down. But, we will see how things do and this will be a good experience, nonetheless.

I can’t say the experience in itself was good but it was useful.

Lately, I’ve noticed that I’m stretching myself too thin. For most of my life, I’ve remained in roles for far longer than I should have. The problem is that I didn’t want to go through the awkward process of potentially upsetting others, even if it meant putting myself last, avoiding conflict, burying the resentment, and prolonging my misery.

The root of this all is the fact that I’m not okay with myself. When you’re not okay with me, I look to the validation of others to fill in the void. One way is the please others.

So, instead of trying to remain in everyone’s good books — or at least, thinking I was — by putting aside how I felt, what did I want to do?

I knew I didn’t have the passion for this vice presidency role. I detest endless communication, processes, and feeling unheard.

I must say that service like this often goes thanklessly. It’s tough. But also gives us meaning, purpose and a sense of community.

I’m grateful to have had experienced some of it. And I respect those who continue to be in these roles.

However, when the overall trend is worsening mood and lack of enjoyment, give yourself permission to step away.

I’m hoping I made the right decision in resigning from this role. It might be a turning point where I start to live life for me. And you, as a reader, I hoping what you can take away from this is that it’s okay to give up on things that you don’t find joy in — or don’t align with your vision as a person. Sure, it’s going to be awkward at first, but are you okay with putting up with short term pain for long term happiness?

What do you think about my decision to resign? What would you do differently? Are you going through a similar experience?

PS: I purchased a bass guitar and plan to learn bass for the first time ever. And I’m also learning some flutter as well.
