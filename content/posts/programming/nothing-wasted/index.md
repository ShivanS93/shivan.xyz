Here is some advice passed down by my immediate superior - nothing is ever wasted.

Without much context, this advice is vague, but I'll provide two examples for clarity:

1. Working on issues that get dropped
2. Introducing an external package only for this to be rejected
3. Working on an implementation only to realise there is a better way

Often, in order something to be useful, it must serve some purpose. For example, if we were to work on an issue, or implementation or introduce an external package, it better be used in production code, else it was a waste of time.

You see, the biggest torture for any human being is meaningless tasks that provide no stimulus to progress. Instruct a person to lift these rocks from point A to point B, and when they are done, move them back again - they will go insane.

The world of software development is no different, or so it seems.

If you are ever in situation where you have worked on a issue, feature or even project only for it to get dropped for something else seemingly "better", I want to let you know that your efforts didn't go to waste.

We simple need some reframing. Working on these things are learning oppourtunities. And learning oppourtunites are never a waste of time.
