The CTO I work with did an outstanding job explaining techinical debt during a product demo meeting we had with the stakeholders, which is the main inspiration for this post.

Not everyone in the meeting has a techinical background or has the capacity to do so. So having this discussion is very much appreciated.

Why? Picture this. You are in the development team and a person from outside the development team asks you to implement this seemingly trivial feature. And they expect it to be done by today with no bugs. Not so trivial now, is it?

### What is techinical debt?

In an ideal world, no techinical debt would be perfect, but just like bootstrappinga business expeting to take on no risk - that's just a pipe dream.

The problem becomes when the debt grows out of control. You struggle to even make those interest payments back to the loan.

But if you are able to take up more credit, it comes as a an oppourtunity costs. You could take on more credit and utilise this to increase more revuenue, but at the cost of more risk. How much risk is too much risk? There is an obvious amount as to too much or too little, but it's up to you in terms of how much you and your team are willing to stomach.

I'm still learnign about this by the way.

For anyone with a business backgroud, it's easier to explain this with the use of finances.

Building software isn't as easy as we would like to think it is. A features is normally built on the premise of what "just works". There are monetary constraings, time constraints to deliver something that is _just_ working.

Communication - creates a human components.

We must remind ourselves that code even though it is executed by a non-sentient being like a server or a computer, it's written by human beings, usually a team of them, who are prone to error.

Openness is important and understanding because then there are less likely to be secrets held between the two parties - the techinical team and the non-technical team.
