In Typescript/Javascript, the `const` keywords doesn't necessarily mean that the variable will be constant. In the case of arrays and objects, these can still be mutated.

This is opposed to Rust, where all variables declared are immutable by default and must declared so if otherwise.

Here is the video covering the topic.
