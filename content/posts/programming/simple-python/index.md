Python is a fantastic programming language for any beginner. However, a small pitfall is setting up a project and it's dependencies, which will eventually happen as you improve and get better.

Remember, that a language stays the same to entice the beginners, but you as a developer will improve.

Rust, a more difficult language to get started with, is much more elegant in it's way of dealing with dependencies.

So, in this post, I want to provide a simple way of setting up Python for expert development (I must disclaim that I am no expert and have plenty to learn).
