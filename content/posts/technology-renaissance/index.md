\*DING\* - Excitement. A notification!

For some context, I am a part of a dance group, and a way to keep up to date with events, classes, and socials is through a group chat that we have on [Messenger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_(software)>). And to add to this context, I've been really getting into dance. Socials are a good oppourtunity to improve my skill, so you can probably tell why I'd be excited to get a notification.

Continuing on... I open the chat.

The excitement I had turns into slight annoyance.

It's a new event, but it's a link.

A link to a [Facebook event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features#Events).

There is no indication of place or time, so I have to take dreaded action.

I clicked the link.

Now I'm transported into another realm. And not a one I'd like to go to.

My mobile browser fires up (yes, I don't have Facebook on my phone, so the only way to access Facebook is through mobile).

I log in.

And I'm bombarded by information I'm not interested, random short video reels, what my 'friends', who I added too long ago and never keep up with personally, are up to.

All I want to know where and when this event is. But I'm met with a lot of noise.

It's a petty example, but it's one example where I think the technology we have isn't serving us too well.

And probably for _good_ reason. [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms) are _free_ platforms that rely on data collection of it's users as well as serving meaningful ads in order to run as a business. That means the platform relies on our engagement and too be on longer than we would expect. Does that mean the best user experience? Not at all.

A lot of online platforms work in this way, where the user experience isn't the number one priority, rather it's keeping you on the platform for longer.

But I'm feeling there is technology induced malaise among the masses, or I could be entirely wrong. [Please let me know what you think](mailto:me@shivan.xyz).

Remember when facebook came out? When you watch "Social Network", you get that nostalgic feeling like you are on the cusp of something game changing.

How amazing? Computer and the internet wasn't a niche nerdy thing anymore, it was finally for the masses and it wasn't so scary to use.

Facebook had some amazing features. The ability to see what your friend were up to not just locally but from all around you. You would instance message your friends either individually or in groups. Facebook had groups that you could join.That's how I knew what was going on in my optopmetry class, and how I knew everyone.

Burnt out by technology. Open youtube app - adds and attention grabinng and sucking things and I think it's only going to get worse.

My responsibility in someone in tech to use the right tools.

Trying to aim for tech independence.

Stopping using substack because of privacy trackers. I don't need to see the views, I just need to get the idea out there.
