\*DING\* - Excitement. A notification!

For some context, I am a part of a dance group, and a way to keep up to date with events, classes, and socials is through a group chat that we have on [Messenger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_(software)>). And to add to this context, I've been really getting into dance. Socials are a good oppourtunity to improve my skill, so you can probably tell why I'd be excited to get a notification.

Continuing on... I open the chat.

The excitement I had turns into slight annoyance.

It's a new event, but it's a link.

A link to a [Facebook event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features#Events).

There is no indication of place or time, so I have to take dreaded action.

Clicking the link, I'm now transported into an unwanted realm.

As soon as my mobile browser fires up I am bombarded by information that I'm not interested in, random short video reels, friends' activities.

**All I want to know is the location and time of this event.**

This is one example where I think the technology we have isn't serving us well at all.

And probably for _good_ reason. [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms) are _free_ platforms that rely on data collection as well as advertisements in order to run as a business.

That means the platform relies on our engagement. And they are competed with other platforms that also use this model. The outcome is that we are on the platform for longer than we expect to me.

I'd argue this goes against a good [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience). You are on the platform, but do you really want to be there.

[Reed Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings), CEO of [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix), said it himself: "so we actually compete with sleep". You would rather be sleeping, but just one more episode...

If your wellbeing and sanity isn't the top priority, then what does this lead to?

I call it a **technology malaise**.

And it's hard the get away from it. You can't ditch social media, since we are so dependent on it. If I stopped using Messenger for example, then I won't know when the next social will take place.

## Yearning for what was

Remember when Facebook came out? I didn't think of it a big deal at the time. But when I watch \*[_The Social Network_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network), I have this great sense of nostalgia and amazement.

Computers and the internet weren't just a niche hobby, it was for everyone. Anyone of nearly any ability could create a Facebook profile and start interacting with their friends. Anonymity wasn't a deal anymore as people would be willing to use their real names and share images of themselves and their family online.

It changed our behaviour at a global scale.

How amazing?

You could keep in touch with friends not just within a local area, but even if they had moved on. Think about old school friends. Strangers you meet while travelling but end up connected and staying in touch online.

These are all amazing things.

Facebook had some amazing features. The ability to see what your friend were up to not just locally but from all around you. You would instance message your friends either individually or in groups. Facebook had groups that you could join.That's how I knew what was going on in my optopmetry class, and how I knew everyone.

Burnt out by technology. Open youtube app - adds and attention grabinng and sucking things and I think it's only going to get worse.

My responsibility in someone in tech to use the right tools.

Trying to aim for tech independence.

Stopping using substack because of privacy trackers. I don't need to see the views, I just need to get the idea out there.
