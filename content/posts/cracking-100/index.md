I’ve had my first week of part-time work done and dusted. I thoroughly enjoyed it despite being extremely nervous.

I started taking YouTube more seriously back in October 2021. After almost 3 months, I’m on the verge of cracking 100 subscribers.

What does that mean? It means a custom URL and not a random hash.

How long does it take to get monetised? That is going to take far longer. You need at least 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours. So far I have 75 hours of total watch time.

Thanks to those who have subscribed and supported me.

This weeks video is about remakes and rechecks. I don’t like rechecks because they make me feel incompetent as an optometrist.
