## Summary

- **What**: AWS re:Invent
- **When**: 2nd - 6th December 2024
- **Where**: Las Vegas
- **Why**: Investing in my skills as a developer

Five days, up to 60,000 people, over 3000 speakers, 5 hotels dedicated for content. **One life changing event**.

I had the immense privilege of attending one of the biggest conferences in the technology industry, [AWS re:Invent 2024](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/).

I left inspired, overloaded, feeling completely out of my depth, and amazed at what can be achieved with AWS services.

However, I do wish I had some tips on what to expect from this event. And that is what I will try and achieve with this post - advice to my former self.

Who is my former self?

- First time at AWS re:Invent
- First time to a technology conference
- Little AWS experience

## What is AWS?

Simply put, [Amazon Web Services or AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is a cloud service. They offer hundreds of services around compute, storage, databases, machine learning, and the list goes on.

For example, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is one of their first services [launched back in 2006](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2006/3/amazon-web-services-launches). S3 offers object storage.

## My AWS Experience and Focus for the Conference

For my job, we use AWS, but I'm not working our infrastructure day-to-day. I am a developer and I mainly contribute to writing code.

My only experience with AWS is playing around with the console, creating random S3 buckets and spawning an [EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), only to focus on ssh'ing into the server to practice system admin and linux skills.

You can say I have very little exposure to AWS coming into this event. You could even call me a complete beginner.

Despite this, I expect to be pushed outside my comfort zone with this conference.

I'm going to feel out of my depth. There will be people working for large companies, on very complex and important problems. On top of this, there will be very smart individuals, much smarter than I am. And that's okay, I'm there to learn.

Great advice given by a previous mentor is to be a generalist. It's time to take the blinkers off. Instead of focusing on code, I'll be diving into the world of devops. In doing so, I hope to become more of a complete developer.

On top of this, re:Invent is a good oppourtunity for me to meet people in the technology sector. This is probably the only oppourtunity where I am going to see so many people who are in the technology realm.

The rules:

- It I'm waiting in line, I'll introduce myself to anyone in queues.
- If I'm going to have a meal, I'll try and sit with a stranger and get to know them.
- If I'm on the shuttle bus, I'll talk to the person I'm sitting next to.
- If I'm sitting down watching a talk or taking a lab, I'll say hello to whomever is sitting next to me.

## Planning

I was overwhelmed with not on the conference but with Las Vegas itself. I had no guidance going in and it's always going to feel like you're "missing" oppourtunities.

For that, I wouldn't fret. Forgive yourself and do the best you can. There is always next time.

That being said, I'm hoping this post will give you some head start.

### Booking the Conference

You can book the conference through the AWS Events [portal](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) dedicated to the re:Invent conference.

Through the portal, you can also book accommodation on the Las Vegas Strip at an bonus rate.

### Where to Stay?

{{<figure src="/mandalay-bay.jpg" alt="Towering building with lite signage saying 'Mandalay Bay Hotel'" caption="My accommodation for the week in Las Vegas">}}

There are plenty of hotels to stay on the Las Vegas Strip. I opted to stay at the Manadalay Bay, which is at the south end of the strip and also one of the five hotels hosting content for the conference. This is the reason I chose to stay here as well as an afforable rate.

At the time, I arrived I thought it would have been better to stay at the Venetian, since this is where the keynotes took place as well as the Expo hall. But now when writing this, I think it was a fine decision to book the Mandalay Bay, since there was good transport between hotel venues (via the free shuttle).

### Events App

About a month before the actual conference, there is the ability to book events using their events app.

There are thousands of talks to choose from and to make it easier to search through them, the app offers a comprehensive filters. You can filter by experience, topics, location, content type and so on (I'll make an attempt to explain these content types later on, but be weary that the AWS team are constantly iterating on this idea).

You might see that most of the events are fully reserved. This doesn't mean that the event is completely full. This isn't official information, but from talking to others at the conference, not all seats are able to be reserved. There will be some seats for walk-in, which is for a first-come-first-serve basis. If some of the reserved members don't turn up within 10 minutes of the event, then their seats are released to those in the walk-in.

The only downside is that you will to need queue early for an event depending on how popular the event is. If you are near the end of the queue, then there is chance that they will run out of seats. This did happen to me on a few occasions.

## Arriving in Las Vegas and the First Weekend

Not only is this my first technology conference, this is also my first time in Las Vegas. I made the effort to travel the weekend before to do some exploring and tourist things.

{{<figure src="/las-vegas-airport.jpg" alt="Sign above an archway displaying the text 'Welcome to Las Vegas'" caption="Entering the madness of Las Vegas">}}

I landed Friday afternoon, 29th November. I met with some other conference-goers at Harry Reid Airport and took to the taxi to my accommodation, Mandalay Bay.

As soon as I checked in, I walked down the Las Vegas strip. It was bustling to say the least.

Also, in the weekend I made the effort to visit the Grand Canyon, and Hoover Dam.

I finished Satuday evening with Michael Jackson ONE, which was the show for the Manadalay Bay. A spectacular watch.

My colleague arrived Satuday night, but we caught up on Sunday, where we spent time with resident colleagues of Las Vegas (our company org-chart is a bit complicated).

We also headed to the Venetian to pick up our badges and some free merchandise. We also got a taste of what's to come!

## The Conference

### Monday 2nd December

Remember, how I am a complete AWS noob? I took the oppourtunity of take the "Tech Essentials" bootcamp.

The bootcamp was a day long event and it's goal was to take you from zero knowlegdge to having some bearing of AWS.

I found it extremely useful. There was a main speaker who would run through the main points. For example, explaining [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and then after talking about this topic, we would perform a lab exercise with a dummy AWS environment.

There were a number of friendly helpers, who are also a part of AWS who are happy to answer questions about the labs, or you can even ask them for advice about the conference. One individual gave me the idea to head to the Expo hall, where they have AWS solution architects (experts in the area of AWS) and whiteboards so you can talk over specific problems.

We also covered other topics like EC2, databases, storage.

### Tuesday 3rd December

Tuesday morning was the keynote by the AWS CEO, Matt Garmen. This was quite good because this where a lot of announcement on new technologies as well as the direction of the company. Since I am new to AWS, I didn't find this talk compared to someone else who is on the bleeding edge of AWS technologes.

I didn't go to the Venetian to watch this live, instead I watched this from the Content Hub at Mandalay Bay. [More on the Content Hub](#content-hub).

{{<youtube LY7m5LQliAo>}}

After the talk, I met up with the the boss of our AWS account manager (I think). Since we are an AWS customer, we are assigned to an account manager. This is quite good to know because an AWS account manager is there to help you out.

For example, if you have a questions about setting up your AWS services, the account manager has access to a solutions architect to walk your through the process. The bonus is that this does not incur any extra charge.

I also went to some talks about. One related to S3 and another related to setting up infrastructure in China, which has its own complications.

At the end of this day, there are many "after-party" like events thrown. Usually, emails are sent requiring RVSP to an invitation. There is also an community-created events page to keep track of these parties.

One after-party that my colleague and I attended was Top Golf with others from the Australia and New Zealand region. I met an individual from Wellington who had a golden jacket. This represented earning all the AWS certifications and he told me it took him 7 years to complete.

### Wednesday 4th December

I attended in interesting event in the morning. It's better to describe it than give it a name. It involved simulating a C-suite "war room" for a business. You would make decisions and based on these decisions, you would get a score on how well the business is doing.

The example we were given was navigating technical debt. This was quite different to how I do my job. In my job, I'm focusing on code. In this exercise, I'm thinking at a more strategic level. On top of this, I was communicating with stranger at the conference, further getting outside my comfort zone.

This took place at the [Content Hub](#content-hub).

In the afternoon, I ventured into to Venetian and walked around the Expo hall. This was a huge space, where lots of companies had their booths set up. Remember on day one, where one of the helpful AWS people told me to talk to the people around the whiteboards? That's what I did.

At the center of the Expo hall, there were experts for every topic in AWS. Whiteboards set up for databases, one for storage, one for compute and so on. We would diagram the application at work and they would offer improvements and "how-to-dos".

At the end of the evening, I missed out on the after-party events because most were too full. So, I took some time for myself and went to local dance studio and did a lesson in Salsa.

#### Content Hub

Each hotel that was hosted content had a Content Hub. This acted as a centralised area where you can watch different talks (there were headsets for a particular talk). On top of this, there was Peer talks (where you can have group chats or one-on-ones with other people). Finally, there were computers present for self-directed learning.

One discovery I made was [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/), where during week of the conference, attendees had free access. AWS Skill Builder offers a collection of hands-on courses, where you can learn particular AWS technology. I thought this would be useful if you want to play around with a particular technology without having to commit to entire course programme.

### Thursday 5th December

Everyday at re:Invent there is a keynote. On Tuesday, the CEO gave their keynote as you recall. Most of the keynotes, though presented well, I feel they are presenting to the press. However, the keynote for this morning would be different.

This talk was given by the Amazon.com, Chief Technology Officer, Dr Werner Vogels.

{{<youtube aim5x73crbM>}}

This was a highly anticipated talk for me. I made the attempt to leave my accommodation early, at about 6:30am, travelling to the Venetian.

I had breakfast and lined up outside the venue at about 7:15am. Doors opened at 8:00am. My eyes were watering and hair rising - a four string quartet was playing live. This only hightened my emotions: I could not believe I was here. I was so grateful for this experience that I was having. It felt like I was dreaming.

Aside from this dramatic appreciation, the talk begin at 8:30am. Vogels discussed stragegies for reducing complexity in systems, which is a topic my old mentor and I had had in the past.

Vogels also made come announcements like distributed relational databases and how the technology behind this works.

After this outstanding talk, I met up with my colleague and we explored the Expo hall even further.

At the end of the night, there was a fun activity planned for all attendees of the conference. This was AWS re:Play. They had an open bar, a skating rink, a low sensory zone; however, the major highlight for myself and my colleague was the concert. They had two artists: [Weezer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer) and [Zedd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zedd).

### Friday 6th December

The re:Play party finished late so that warranted a slight sleep in. There were some good talks and tutorials in the morning. This included: a tutorial on distributed SQL databases, and using terraform for deploys. Sadly, these were fully booked and I even missed out on the walk in.

This is no problem as I can always look into these topics later on.

So I spent the rest of Friday morning play around with the AWS Skill builder as discussed before, while also talking to random individuals.

The conference was officially over at lunchtime and since this was my last night in Las Vegas, my colleague and I made our way to Freemont Street (and officially being in Las Vegas).

{{<figure src="/fire.jpg" alt="People surrounded by a mechanical pray mantis shooting fire out of its antennae" caption="The Freemont Street Experience">}}

The next morning was my exit out of Las Vegas. I checked out and fly out to Los Angeles, where I'd make my trip back home to New Zealand.

Fun fact: when I was flying from Auckland to Palmerston North, I was sitting next to a lady why is a scrum master, she was well versed in AWS and I was able to talk about my conference to her.

## Reflections

The level of gratitude to have my company sponsor my trip to AWS re:Invent in inmeasurable. I feel loved, because instead of viewing software development as a cost, it's viewed as something worth investing in - like this conference.

I'm hoping to bring back some value into the business for going. The biggest thing is being inspired to learn AWS so I can use it better in the company that I work for.

I really hope that my AWS skills will improve and I will be able to take more in the next time I go.

My lead asked me about how the conference was and I mentioned that I left inspired. He told me to never underestimate inspiration. So, we can say this conference was a giagantic success! A significant highlight of 2024 and probably in my life.
