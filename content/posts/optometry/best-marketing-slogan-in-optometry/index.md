_1984_, George Orwell's classic depicting post-apocalyptic world with Big Brother watching us all. Apple also released their iconic "Why 1984 won't be like _1984_" television advertisment, hinging on that Orwellian motif.

1984 was also the birth year of an optical company that would change the landscape of optometry in New Zealand and Australia many years later, first starting in the United Kingdom. That company is Specsavers.

According to the [well-kept wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specsavers), Specsavers boasts a revenue well over Â£2 billion pounds, with over 2,000 stores spread across man European countries like Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada as well the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.

Love it or hate it, we can't doubt how well spread and dominate Specsavers is in the optical industry.

But I don't want to discuss the success of Specsavers, I want to look into what I think is the most successful marketing campaign in the world.

Now you might think that it's free eye exams if you purchase glasses or if you are part of some elite group! Or the various 2 for 1 deals and loss leaders plastered on the shop fronts.

These worked. But it's none of these. These are unique. Go to any supermarket, discount store and you will see the same tactics being used.

"Should've gone to Specsavers"

If I'm my barber and tell them what I do. This slogan will be mentioned. If I'm at a family function, this slogan will be mentioned. If I go to any networking event, guess what will be mentioned? And it's not just optometry and people in the optics industry who are aware of this phrase.

I want to go as far to say that this collection of words put this company on the map. Going beyond companies vision, the team, and what is stood for? What were the company values? I worked there for 3 years and still have no clue. But this marketing slogan still rings true to this day, even as I'm preparing the change careers.

But who was responsible for this almost Steve Jobs like level of influence? More valuable than the spectacles that Jobs wore.

You would think Specsavers would have had to source this special talent from an agency.

Nope! It was all done in house!

Graham Daldry joined Specsavers in the year of 1999 and remained at the company for the next twenty years. For most of his time, he was the creative director for Specsavers advertising team.

[In the Inside Jobs podcast](https://www.ijpodcast.com/episode/a-legacy-of-shouldves/), he mentions how it was head hunted for the role. He even mentions their working wasn't "amazing" but Specsavers did have the motivation to dramatically improve. At the time, Specsavers were in a good position at the time but they lacked a human focus on their marketing face.

Humour was necessary for the brand at the time, because it was such an opticians such a clinical area and Specsavers was a disruptive force in the market place adn humnour was perfect really to kind of 1st of all get people to like us and trust us and differentiate Specsavers from the pack.

[According to his own website](https://grahamdaldry.com/shouldve), in 2002, history was made when he coined that famous tag line, now, a cultural phenomenena - at least in the world of optics.

Here is one of the advertisements:

It didn't stop there, after there were a sleuth of advertisements following the same archetecture of humour.

Humour is powerful. It cements a brand into the minds of viewers. When optometry is viewed as something stale, boring and expensive. These advertisements provide light in a literal dark room. And they work. Hence my experience with inviduals outside the optics industry being able to recite this line better than the national anthem.

Now when you think about vision problems. Or needing to replace your broken glasses. It's not the small independant optometry clinic down the road that your parents, grandparents and great parents religiously attended, it's going to be Specsavers.

In a podcast, Daldry describes Specsavers as a family friendly optometry brand. And that is what he achieved but utilising humour as the spearhead for his furture advertisements.

I want to say that Daldry put Specsavers on the map and largely responsible for the success of the company today. It made me think. The biggest effect an individual has on optometrist, isn't even an optometrist! They will be a marketer of a big c-suit executive.

It's funny the biggest effect on optometry isn't by and optometrist but a top level marketer. Are we seeing the effect of post-captilism? This post isn't suppose to be pollitical or critise the flaws in the foundations of human society. I'm just pointing our my exetential dread while simultaneosly praising and individual's effort and insulting a big corporation at the same time. Did I make that effect?

Even as Daldry moves on to bigger and possibly better projects, his creative efforts will be forever in the realm of optometry.

Even branching into audiology
