1984 was a special year. It was the title of George Orwell's classic, marking a post apocalyptic world with Big Brother watching us all. Apple also released their iconic "Why 1984 won't be like *1984*" television advertisment, hinging on that Orwellian motif.

1984 was also the birth year of an optical company that would change the landscape of optometry in New Zealand and Australia many years later, first starting in the United Kingdom. That company is Specsavers.

According to the [well-kept wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specsavers), Specsavers boasts a revenue well over Â£2 billion pounds, with over 2,000 stores spread across man European countries like Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Canada as well the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.

Love it or hate it, we can't doubt how well spread and dominate Specsavers is in the optical industry.

But I don't want to discuss the success of Specsavers, I want to look into what I think is the most successful marketing campaign in the world.

Now you might think that it's free eye exams if you purchase glasses or if you are part of some elite group! Or the various 2 for 1 deals and loss leaders plastered on the shop fronts.

These worked. But it's none of these. These are unique. Go to any supermarket, discount store and you will see the same tactics being used.

"Should've gone to Specsavers"

If I'm my barber and tell them what I do. This slogan will be mentioned. If I'm at a family function, this slogan will be mentioned. If I go to any networking event, guess what will be mentioned?

I want to go as far to say that this collection of words put this company on the map. Going beyond companies vision, the team, and what is stood for? What were the company values? I worked there for 3 years and still have no clue. But this marketing slogan still rings true to this day, even as I'm preparing the change careers.

But who was responsible for this almost Steve Jobs like level of influence?

You would think Specsavers would have had to source this special talent from an agency.

Nope! It was all done in house!

Graham Daldry joined Specsavers in the year of 1999.
