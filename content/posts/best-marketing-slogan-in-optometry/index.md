One of Apple Machitosh's most iconic advertisements, "Why 1984 won't be like _1984_" hinges on the Orwellian motif of surveilance and authoritarianism but promises disruption against the cultural normality of the time, which was technology only belonged to big old boring businesses.

Fast forward to present day, their products are the pinnable of design and innovation. We cannot argue how influential Apple as a company has become from personal computing all the way to the smartphone and beyond.

In an industry that doesn't get as much spotlight, the same year saw birth of an optical company that would evetually change the landscape for optometry in New Zealand and Australia.

First starting in the United Kingdom, the business would spread across many European countries such Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, even heading into Canada.

32 years after it's cretation, 2008 would see the expanse of the company to the shores of Australia and New Zealand.

[Boasting revenue well over Â£2 billion pounds with 2,000 stores across the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specsavers), love it or hate it, we cannot doubt the juggernaut Specsavers, the company, has become.

### What's the secret sauce?

Before getting carried away with tallying to successes of this company, I want to look at what I think is one of the most successful marketing campaigns in the world, or the the optical world at least.

If you are familiar with the Specsavers model, you might be thinking it's cost effective eye examinations and glasses. That must be the trick, right?

These probable work. But they are hardly anything special.

So what is that special sauce? To answer that, let me tell you a brief story.

Whenever I met someone new, who was from outside the optics industry and tell them what I do (or did), more often than not, they would mention this particular catch phrase.

"Should've gone to Specsavers".

The most important line in the company's history.

Embarrassingly, I cannot tell you Specsavers's values and vision despite being employed by them for three years, but I can still remember this slogan very, very well.

And who was responsible for leading the team that came up with this phrase and subsequent advertisements reconised my many?

Joining Specsavers in 1999 and remaining in the company for the next twenty years thereafter, Graham Daldry was the _in-house_ creative director for the marketing team.

[In the Inside Jobs podcast](https://www.ijpodcast.com/episode/a-legacy-of-shouldves/), Daldry mentions how he was head hunted for the role. Despite Specsavers, at the time, were not "amazing", they did had the motivation to dramatically improve. What was lacking was a human focus on their marketing.

Daldry identified that humour was necessary for the brand at the time. You can imagine a trip to opticians is a dry experience because it's so clinical. And that would experienced across the whole board no matter which optician you saw.

Humour works well because it gets people to like you, trust you and differentiate yourself from the pack.

[And in 2002](https://grahamdaldry.com/shouldve), a culural phenomenena was born.

Here is one of the advertisements:

And it didn't stop there, using the same comical framework, sleuth of advertisements followed, furthering cementing the company in the mind of consumers. Correlating with that, was Specsavers's expansion and popularity.

Now when you, your friends, or family have any problems with their eyesight or vision, most will know where to go.

We know there are many hands that go into the success of a company, but I want to say that Daldry's work at Specsavers was a very significant in the world of optometry. And I do chuckle at the fact the one's who create the most influence in an industry aren't the ones who work in the industry themselves. In other words, an optometrist wasn't responsible for this, it was a top-level marketer.

Even as Daldry moves on to bigger and possibly better projects, his creative efforts will be forever in the realm of optometry.

### What does this teach us?

It seems the pinnacle of an optometrist is to own a practice. This is fine, but I do think owning a practice is a job in itself with limitations in impact. You may own the business in the beginning but what evetually happens in the business begins to own you.

So, what's the next level then? To refer to the "E-myth Revisited" (a book I started reading, haven't finished, but heard lots about), the optometrist must not work _in_ the business but _on_ the business.

Sounds simple, but there are a few drawbacks to applying this model to optometry.

To expand, an optometrists can't see patients and also work on the business at the same time. To gain this time to focus on the business, the optometrist can hire more optometrists.

Here is the first pitfall, there aren't many optometrists to go around. Especially, if the location your practice is in it not desirable to the average individual (e.g. rural vs urban).

Additionally, patients will want to see a particular optometrist, who might also be the owner.

That's where creating the brand becomes key. Switch patients from seeing a particular optometrist to a branded institution.

Now, we start to see the power of marketing and advertising. It becomes the most powerful thing. Even more powerful that the skill of an optometrist.

Now the optometrist is free to build their brand, purchase more practices, hire more optometrists and grow the business.

This is one way, but not the only way. And the goal of becoming bigger and bigger doesn't even have to be the goal.

### Conclusion

"Should've gone to Specsavers" is a hallmark of marketing in the optical world. Nothing even compares to well known this slogan is.
