_You should have stuck with optometry_.

This was the response a person gave to me while they were probing me about my dating life and my career switch.

The person was clearly joking, but my tendency to overthink things led me to the conclusion that I’m still not good enough. Embarking on a new career instead of sticking to what I have already done for years wouldn’t make me a good dating prospect. And being a good dating prospect is important (to me at least!)

I do think when we achieve one goal, the mind quickly finds another problem to try and solve.

But another problem too is that maybe the goal we have set for ourselves aren’t wholesome either.

Maybe those goals persist to impress the expectations of others. I don’t blame you, because impressing yourself is one of the hardest things to do, especially, when we are our own worst critics.

Since telling people about my new career path, I expected jaws drops (I’m so embarrassed by needing to feel this way by the way). But it’s just a job at the end of the day. And the only person who should really be impressed is myself.

In fact, the ultimate goal of life should be that you are able to live your life in a way that you want and you are happy with.

This can be difficult because sometimes I don’t know what’s best for me, and this is where I look to social media, books, friends, parents for feedback — and external validation.
