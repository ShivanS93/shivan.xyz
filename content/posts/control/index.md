I was having a meeting for poor performance.

I checked out of the job. My situation at the time was dire. My ties to my family were non-existent. My relationship with my girlfriend at the time had ended.

I complained about how I felt my job was meaningless.

I would be frustrated when introducing myself as an optometrist.

"why are glasses expensive?"

"how much money do you make?"

A friend of mine asked me how to purchase glasses online; they would kindly donate their hard earn cash to non-taxpaying drug dealers.

Vision is one of the most important senses. It's the biggest fear to lose. Yet eye care and eyewear are commodities not worth valuing!

There are many, many, many more examples of feeling worthless.

**But the best advice I was given, is: control what you can control and deny focus on what others say.**

That was the advice given to me by my boss during that meeting.

Are the opinions and thoughts of others essential to dwell on? No.

There are other things that aren't essential. Keeping up with every detail of the news. Does it really matter who X is dating while cheating on Y and Z at the same time? Scandalous? No.

It's good to know the struggles of what everyone is going through. But I can always get that through a second party (family and friends).

Ask yourself what is essential?

Anxiety is worrying about the uncontrollable future. Regret is focusing on past mistakes. They either will never happen or not changeable. The present is in your control. The present is _essential_. Take it a step further. Learn and be grateful for your past. Then, take action in the present for what your future self will be thankful for.

What can you focus on now to build your better future?
