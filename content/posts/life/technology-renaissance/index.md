So, I am a part of a dance group, and a way to keep up to date with events, classes, and socials is through a group chat that we have on [Messenger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_(software)>).

\*DING\*

A notification goes off on my mobile! Excitement! Maybe a new event?

I open the chat. Excitement... turns into slight annoyance.

It's a new event. Shouldn't that be exciting? It is.

But it's a link. A link to a [Facebook event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features#Events). There is no indication of place or time, so I have to click this link.

Click. Now I'm transported into my mobile browser (yes, I don't have Facebook on my phone), then I need to log in. On logging in, I'm bombarded by information about up and coming events, random reels, what my 'friends' are up to. All I want to know where and when this event is.

It's a petty example, but it's one example where I think the technology we have isn't serving us too well.

And for _good_ reason. [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms) are free platforms that rely on data collection of it's users as well as serving meaningful ads in order to run as a business. Does this mean the best user experience for us? To point yes, and to a point no.

And this leads me to the point I want to make - technology hadn't been serving us well lately.

I want to preface that I don't think the world is coming to an end [like I sounded in this post]({{< ref "/no-public-media/_index.md" >}}) (by the way, it's perfectly fine to look back at what your wrote in the past and cringe).

But I'm feeling there is technology induced malaise among the masses, or I could be entirely wrong. [Please let me know what you think](mailto:me@shivan.xyz).

Remember when facebook came out? When you watch "Social Network", you get that nostalgic feeling like you are on the cusp of something game changing.

How amazing? Computer and the internet wasn't a niche nerdy thing anymore, it was finally for the masses and it wasn't so scary to use.

Facebook had some amazing features. The ability to see what your friend were up to not just locally but from all around you. You would instance message your friends either individually or in groups. Facebook had groups that you could join.That's how I knew what was going on in my optopmetry class, and how I knew everyone.

Burnt out by technology. Open youtube app - adds and attention grabinng and sucking things and I think it's only going to get worse.

My responsibility in someone in tech to use the right tools.

Trying to aim for tech independence.

Stopping using substack because of privacy trackers. I don't need to see the views, I just need to get the idea out there.
