I want to preface that I don't think the world is coming to an end [like I sounded in this post]({{< ref "/no-public-media/_index.md" >}}) (by the way, it's perfectly fine to look back at what your wrote in the past and cringe).

But I'm feeling there is technology induced malaise among the masses, or I could be entirely wrong. [Please let me know what you think](mailto:me@shivan.xyz).

Remember when facebook came out? When you watch "Social Network", you get that nostalgic feeling like you are on the cusp of something game changing.

How amazing? Computer and the internet wasn't a niche nerdy thing anymore, it was finally for the masses and it wasn't so scary to use.

Facebook had some amazing features. The ability to see what your friend were up to not just locally but from all around you. You would instance message your friends either individually or in groups. Facebook had groups that you could join.That's how I knew what was going on in my optopmetry class, and how I knew everyone.

Burnt out by technology. Open youtube app - adds and attention grabinng and sucking things and I think it's only going to get worse.

Endshitfication

Fast food

My responsibility in someone in tech to use the right tools.

Trying to aim for tech independence.

Stopping using substack because of privacy trackers. I don't need to see the views, I just need to get the idea out there.
