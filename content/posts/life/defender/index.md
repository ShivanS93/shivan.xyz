Recently, I discovered a security vulnerability. Embarrassingly, it existed - undiscoverd - for almost 2 years ðŸ¤¯!

Fortunately, over a few days, I was able to reduce the surface area of exposure, eventually sealing it nice and tight.

The whole process of this fix makes me think about being a [good defender](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(association_football)>).

What do I mean by that? Let me explain.

I played [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) throughout primary, intermediate, and high school, even creeping into university.

I wasn't great at dribbling, passing, or scoring goals, so I naturally defaulted to the position of a defender, where I spent most of my "years".

When everyone would be asked to separate out into their positions, being a defender wasn't so popular.

It's simple. Forwards score the goals and get the glory.

Their success is tangible. Their success is seen: visible on the score sheet.

Contrast this to a well thought out and constructed tackle that was made thanks to intelligent positioning. Only if you were the peer into an alternate reality when this tackle wasn't made and a goal was scored by the opposite team do you see the effectiveness of the defenders work.

What about mistakes? When a forward makes a mistake, it's usually a missed shot on goal. Better luck next time.

For a defender, it's a worse penalty, like conceding a goal and losing the game.

It's often said: forwards bring in the tickets, while defenders win the games.

This analogy has made me think about the nature of work and this security vulnerability that was discovered.

Thankfully, this exploit was discovered by myself and not anyone outside the team. There weren't any heroics - like a miraculous slide tackle to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Nope, just a nondescript carefully thoughtout tackle from harmless up the pitch.

All this, while the others are building cool features that are visible and tangible for the fans to adore.

We weren't in a position to share this information for two reason. The first it's embarrassing, so we are better of keeping it within the team. And second, no one external to the development team why this was so significant of an issue.

If you find yourself in this situation, what do you do?

You are the unsung hero. A true team player and asset. I speak for myself really, but I love validation. It exciting showing cool new features to stakeholders, and that they pat you on the back for doing a good job.

I find it hard to tell myself that I am doing a good job. I always needed the validation. But in this scenario, I need to be proud of myself - I discovered and stopped a security vulnerability. I learnt more about a particular service that I did not originally set up, but I know how to secure it.

My mentor said to me: there is always someone taking the spotlight, and if you aren't seeing someone else get the spotlight, then it's probably you.

In this case, I'm not in the spotlight despite my high impact effort (I know I'm talking myself up a bit). And that's okay, because you aren't the only one who has gone through this.

And just because I am not getting the praise, doesn't mean I'm on the chopping block either. I am doing fine.

My time will come. But for now, I am just going to be grateful that things weren't worse. I repeat: remain a good defender.
