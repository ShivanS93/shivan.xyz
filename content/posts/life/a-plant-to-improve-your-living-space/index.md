Technology has allowed us to remain connected with our loved ones across the globe from the very comfort of our home. We no longer need to venture outside to find entertainment if it is as easy as turning on your WiFi router.

Even now, most of our jobs are located inside a confined space of an office building.

With all that indoor time increasing, here is one item you can get to improve your living space – be it work or home.

And as the title suggest - the humble peace lilly.

## The Indoor Plant Air Purification Study

In 1989, the United States Federal Government’s agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), conducted a study on several indoor plants and how they can improve the air quality in an indoor space.

The 1970s saw an energy crisis, which meant that businesses had to make their office spaces more efficient in order to reduce costs in lighting, and temperature control.

However in the effort to save on utilities, it was found that the modern furnishing required for efficiency released undetectable traces of volatile chemicals into the air.

These chemicals made workers fall ill. This phenomenon was termed ‘sick building syndrome’.

To combat against this, a complicated technology would have to be developed to reduce these chemicals in the air. With cost-cutting in mind, would this be the most economic option?

An alternative to expensive innovation often is our inclination to observe nature. What we find is an inexpensive alternative to our problem: the indoor plant.

Biological taxonomy is used to classify all known living organisms, from the animals that roam the African plains to the bacteria that exist on a Petri dish.

Plants exist under the biological kingdom of Plantae.

The most relevant characteristic of Plantae to this article is the ability to photosynthesise.

**Photosynthesis** is the chemical reaction that involves taking the energy from the sun and turning water and carbon dioxide (CO2) into a unit of storable energy, glucose, and releasing oxygen (O2) in exchange.

Most other living organisms require oxygen to survive, including us as humans. Oxygen is required in **respiration**, which turns glucose into energy in order for our bodily functions to work.

Therefore, plants are important in maintaining the sensitive balance of life on earth.

They also act as natural air purifiers, and we see why in this NASA study.

In this study, a number of indoor plants of different varieties were used to test its ability to reduce the pollutants known to cause ‘sick building syndrome’: benzene, trichloroethylene, formaldehyde – **volatile organic compounds** (**VOCs**).

**The key findings of the NASA study: Indoor plants not only increased oxygen in the air but also reduced the amount of VOCs as well**.

Notably, the peace lily was able to do this particularly well with most of the types of VOCs.

## How Indoor Plants Filter the Air

There are a number of complex mechanisms at play that filter these harmful VOCs.

One mechanism involves passage through the stomata. Stomata are microscopic pores located on the leaves of the plant. The leaves of the plant are required to not only absorb sunlight required for photosynthesis, but they also act as the sights in which photosynthesis takes place.

The carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis enters the plant through the stomata. In the case of VOCs, they also enter this route.

Another mechanism involves the plant’s roots. The roots of the plant are responsible for providing anchorage for the plant. The root also also absorbs water and nutrients from the soil that it is embedded.

The root and surrounding soil also contains microbes (bacteria and fungi) as well as activated carbon. This allows for absorption and breakdown of these VOCs, which get turned into building blocks that eventually make up the plant1.

We can understand that these mechanisms help reduce the harmful compounds, purifying the air we breathe.

## The Danger of Ozone

To labour this point a bit more. Another study looked at ozone (O3) with indoor plants2. Peace Lily did not perform as well, and this is why it can be good to have a slight variety.

The Spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum) was found to remove ozone effectively3.

We know that the depletion of ozone at the ozone layer is responsible for climate change.

Ozone normally exists in the stratosphere. The stratosphere marks the boundary between the atmosphere and the boundary of space4.

Ozone is important as it absorbs harmful ultraviolet type-C (UV-C; short-wave) light and 90% of ultraviolet type-B (UV-B; long-wave) light before it enters the Earth’s atmosphere and approaches us. I have discussed this in my previous article about the blue light affects eye health.

The formation of O3 in the stratosphere involves a two-step process. This process in itself results in its UV blocking ability5.

    An oxygen molecule (O2) absorbs UV-C, causing the molecule to split into two reactive atomic oxygens (oxygen free-radical, O·), and O· combines with O2 to form O3
    O3 absorbs UV-B resulting in the formation of more O2 and the cycle repeats

We can see that ozone in its formation protects us from harmful UV light.

However, if ozone were at the level we breathe, this would result in negative health effects such as problems with breathing due to ozone’s strong oxidant characteristics.

You might notice that it should be impossible for ozone to form at the level we breathe since there is no UV-C light to create oxygen free-radicals, which in turn create ozone.

So, how does the Ozone form in this case? Air pollutants.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an example of an air pollutant common in the burning of fossil fuels6. Sunlight, not specifically just UV-C, results in the formation of an oxygen free-radical from NO2, and this oxygen free-radical is able to react with O2 to create ozone at the level we breathe.

Eliminating pollution can stop our exposure to ozone in the air we breathe. But the indoor plant can help improve quality also.
