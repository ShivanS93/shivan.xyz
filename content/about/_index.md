Greetings, Kia Ora, வணக்கம் 👋

Welcome to my blog!

I am Kiwi born 🇳🇿 with Sri Lankan 🇱🇰 heritage.

I studied at the University of Auckland and graduated in 2016 as fully qualified optometry. Currently, I'm working on a career change transition into technology.

This blog is a culmination of optometry, technology, entrepreneurship, finding meaning, and anything that I find interesting. Hopefully this inspires you and anyone who reads this.

Where else can you find me?
